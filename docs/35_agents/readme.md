# Agents

Agents are virtual implementations of assistants which can solve tasks instructed by human language. An agent typically has access to python functions (called tools) to execute actions, and to an LLM to decide what action to do, to invoke the functions with the right parameters and to interpret the result correctly.

There are a couple for agentic frameworks available which aim at simplifying working with agents.
