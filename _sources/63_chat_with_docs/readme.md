# Simple Chat with Docs

This repository contains a simple Chat interface based on [voila](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila), [OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-api/)  and [llama-index](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index) that allows you to query information from documents using human language.

After installation (see below) you can start the chat using this terminal command:

```
voila chat-with-docs.ipynb
```

The cods in this repository is derived from the tutorial [here](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/getting_started/starter_example/).
