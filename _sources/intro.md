# Generative Artificial Intelligence Notebooks

This page is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks about Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) - focusing on how to use certain techniques using Python.

The collection is currently work-in-progress. Contributions and feedback are very welcome! In case you see room for improvement, please [create a github issue](https://github.com/ScaDS/Generative-AI-notebooks/issues) and/or consider [contributing](https://github.com/ScaDS/Generative-AI-notebooks/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Topics

The notebook collection aims covering these topics:
* Large Language Models (LLMs)
* Vision Language Models (VLMs)
* Multi-modal Language Models
* Image/Text/Code generation
* Multi-agent systems
* Prompt Engineering
* Model fine-tuning
